Some works on Sparse Representation Acceleration using Randomized SVD at Shanghai Key Lab of Intelligent Information Processing under professor Shuigen Zhou from January to July, 2016.

I would probably not work on this project any more, so I made it public for anyone interested in accelerating sparse representation.
